Course No.:CS427
Course Title: Embedded Systems Programming
Number of Credit Hours: 3

Catalog Data:

This course introduces students to principles, methodologies, and procedures for embedded systems. The goal is to learn how to bring hardware (microprocessors, Arduino, Raspberry PI, sensors, displays, etc…) and <span style="color: brown; font-style: oblique;">software </span>(programming language, operating system (windows 10, Linux, etc…)) together to specify, design, and implement system solutions to the production of whole and complete products.

Objectives:

Upon completion of this course, students should be able to:

1.	Identify and appreciate the meaning of embedded systems applications.
2.	Use Microcontroller software with high level programming to develop task oriented applications in real time.
3.	Understand and use real time operating system functions and tools for multi-tasking, inter-networking, memory limitations, hardware resource allocation, etc…
        </div>

Course Contents:

2.	How to build and test circuits with switches, LEDs, resistors, potentiometers, and liquid crystal displays
3.	How to read data sheets of analogue and digital ICs, microprocessors (Arduino, Raspberry PI, etc...) C programming: considering both functions and styles
4.	Hardware/Software architectures of Arduino
5.	Digital input/output for interfacing and synchronization of hardware and software inputs/outputs with switches, lights, sounds, LCDs,sensors and actuators
6.	Timers/Counters Applications for Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) and DC and stepper motor control applications
7.	Analogue Input/Output using Analogue to Digital Converters (ADCs) and Digital to Analogue Converters (DACs)
8.	Implementation of an I/O driver and multi-threaded programming using interrupts
9.	Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) characteristics and applications in embedded systems
10.	Real Time Operating System (RTOS) applications in embedded systems
11.	Raspberry-Pi and ARM processor hardware/software models, programming and applications (image processing, video processing, etc…)
12.	Application Project (How to construct a smart object and create a system as part of the Internet of Things).


Prerequisites:

CE243 (Introduction to Computer Architecture)
CS143 (Introduction to Problem Solving and Programming)
